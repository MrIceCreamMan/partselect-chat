Title: Ice Maker Not Working - Refrigerator Troubleshooting
Category: Ice Maker Issues
Appliance: Refrigerator

Common Causes and Solutions:

1. Ice Maker Power/Control Issues
   - Check if the ice maker is turned on (look for on/off switch or wire signal arm)
   - Verify the control arm is in the "down" position
   - Some models have a pause feature - check if it's activated
   Solution: Turn on the ice maker or lower the control arm

2. Water Supply Problems
   - Check if water supply valve is fully open
   - Inspect water line for kinks or freezing
   - Verify household water pressure is adequate (20-120 psi)
   - Check water inlet valve for clogs or failure
   Solution: Clear kinked lines, thaw frozen lines, replace faulty water inlet valve (Part: W10350375)

3. Frozen Fill Tube
   - Water fill tube can freeze, blocking water flow
   - Look for ice buildup around fill tube
   - Often caused by low freezer temperature
   Solution: Thaw fill tube with warm water, check freezer temperature (should be 0-5°F), replace fill tube if damaged (Part: W10082853)

4. Faulty Ice Maker Assembly
   - Ice maker motor may be burned out
   - Mold thermostat could be defective
   - Broken gears or housing
   Solution: Replace entire ice maker assembly (Part: PS11752778)

5. Water Filter Issues
   - Clogged or old water filter reduces water flow
   - Filter should be replaced every 6 months
   Solution: Replace water filter (Part: PS11757302)

Diagnostic Steps:
1. Verify power and ice maker is ON
2. Check water supply and valve
3. Inspect for frozen fill tube
4. Test ice maker manually (varies by model)
5. Check water filter age and condition
6. If all else fails, replace ice maker assembly
