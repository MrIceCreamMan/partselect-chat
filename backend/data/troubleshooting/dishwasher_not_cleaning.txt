Title: Dishwasher Not Cleaning Dishes Properly
Category: Cleaning Performance
Appliance: Dishwasher

Common Causes and Solutions:

1. Clogged Spray Arms
   - Food particles or mineral deposits block spray holes
   - Arms can't rotate freely
   - Restricted water flow
   Solution: Remove spray arms and clean all holes with toothpick, replace if damaged (Part: WPW10195417)

2. Low Water Temperature
   - Water must be at least 120°F for effective cleaning
   - Check water heater setting
   - Faulty heating element
   Solution: Adjust water heater to 120°F, test and replace heating element if needed (Part: W10508950)

3. Insufficient Water Fill
   - Water inlet valve partially clogged or failing
   - Low household water pressure
   - Faulty float switch
   Solution: Clean or replace water inlet valve (Part: W10350376), check float switch (Part: W10440739)

4. Worn Wash Impeller
   - Impeller circulates water through spray arms
   - Can crack or wear down
   - Reduces water pressure
   Solution: Replace wash impeller (Part: W10826546)

5. Improper Loading
   - Dishes blocking spray arms
   - Overloading prevents water circulation
   - Silverware or utensils falling through rack
   Solution: Follow manufacturer loading guidelines, ensure spray arms can rotate freely

6. Wrong or Old Detergent
   - Expired detergent loses effectiveness
   - Wrong detergent type for water hardness
   - Too little or too much detergent
   Solution: Use fresh detergent appropriate for your water type, follow dosage recommendations

7. Dirty Filter
   - Filter at bottom of tub catches food particles
   - When clogged, reduces cleaning performance
   Solution: Remove and clean filter weekly

8. Clogged Detergent Dispenser
   - Dispenser door won't open
   - Old detergent buildup
   Solution: Clean dispenser thoroughly, ensure door opens freely

Diagnostic Steps:
1. Check water temperature (should reach 120°F)
2. Inspect and clean spray arms
3. Remove and clean filter
4. Verify spray arms rotate freely when loaded
5. Check water inlet valve and pressure
6. Test heating element
7. Replace worn components

Maintenance Tips:
- Run hot water at sink before starting dishwasher
- Clean spray arms monthly
- Use rinse aid for better drying
